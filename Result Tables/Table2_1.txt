# Evaluating adversarial examples generated for the surrogate model on the original model, 
# to evaluate the robustness of the original model. If the adversarial examples 
# generated for the surrogate model are also effective against the original model, 
# then it indicates that the original model is not robust against adversarial attacks. 
# This is because the surrogate model is trained to mimic the behavior of the original 
# model, so if the adversarial examples are successful on the surrogate model, 
# they are likely to be successful on the original model as well. Therefore, 
# creating effective adversarial examples for the surrogate model is an important 
# step in evaluating the robustness of the original model.
